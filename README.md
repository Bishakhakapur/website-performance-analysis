# 📊 Website Performance Analysis Project

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of website performance using session-level data. It focuses on evaluating user engagement trends, traffic patterns, and channel performance using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze website user sessions and behavior across different marketing channels
- Identify peak and low-performing hours for traffic
- Compare engaged vs. non-engaged sessions
- Visualize engagement rates and session counts over time
- Derive actionable insights for marketing or UX optimization

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes 3,182 rows with hourly records of:

- Channel Group (e.g., Direct, Organic Social)
- Date and Hour (`DateHour`)
- Users and Sessions
- Engaged Sessions
- Engagement Rate
- Average Engagement Time
- Events per Session
- Event Count

---

## 🧠 Key Insights & Visualizations

1. **📈 Sessions and Users Over Time** 
   → Time series plot showing how sessions and users fluctuate across days and hours

2. **📊 Total Users by Channel** 
   → Bar plot to understand user distribution by traffic source

3. **🕒 Average Engagement Time by Channel** 
   → Visual comparison of how long users stay engaged across channels

4. **📦 Engagement Rate Distribution** 
   → Box plot to analyze variation in engagement quality by source

5. **🔄 Engaged vs. Non-Engaged Sessions** 
   → Stacked bar chart representing session quality

6. **🔥 Traffic by Hour and Channel (Heatmap)** 
   → Hourly behavior patterns across all marketing channels

7. **📉 Engagement Rate vs. Sessions Over Time** 
   → Line plot showing trends in engagement rate and session volume
